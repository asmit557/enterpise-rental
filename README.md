# 🔧 Future Improvements

While the current version of the application provides a robust foundation for a full-stack real estate rental platform, the following features and enhancements are planned for future iterations:

- **🧠 AI-Powered Recommendations**  
  Integrate machine learning models to suggest properties based on user behavior, preferences, and previous interactions.

- **📍 Drawing and Map Editing Tools**  
  Enable users to draw custom boundaries or shapes on maps to search within specific areas or neighborhoods.

- **📊 Admin Dashboard Analytics**  
  Implement comprehensive data visualization dashboards for property trends, user activity, and revenue insights.

- **🌐 Multilingual Support**  
  Provide localization and translation support for international users to expand the platform's accessibility.

- **🔐 Multi-Tier User Roles**  
  Introduce advanced user roles (agent, buyer, broker, admin) with granular permission controls and dynamic dashboards.

- **📱 Mobile App Support**  
  Extend functionality through a native mobile application built with React Native or Flutter for cross-platform deployment.

- **💬 Real-Time Chat**  
  Integrate Socket.IO or WebSockets for real-time messaging between property owners and potential tenants.

- **📅 Integrated Booking System**  
  Add scheduling features for property visits with calendar sync (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.).

- **🧾 Payment Gateway Integration**  
  Implement secure online rent payments or deposit booking via Stripe or Razorpay for end-to-end transaction handling.

- **🧑‍💻 Developer CLI Tools**
